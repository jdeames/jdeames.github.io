Since 2009, my Edison Huron made from Bexley Yellowstone acrylic has remained the heart of my tiny pen collection. As I write this post, it sits inked on my desk between two Aurora 88s.

This was my first post about the Huron: [Edison Huron in Yellowstone]( /pens/edison-huron ). This pen was also my first "custom" fountain pen.

What brought my Huron purchase about had everything to do with the Bexley Yellowstone acrylic. That pen material was among several Italian compressed acrylics circulating, and Brian was able to obtain it from Howard Levy of Bexley Pens. 

*Side note: Those compressed acrylics had a lot of depth and richness to them. Sheaffer Pens used these materials in marbled blue, brown, green, and "Aspen" for the 1998-2000 Balance II release, perhaps not entirely successfully, but highly sought after by collectors. I say not entirely successfully as there were pen failures/cracks that developed in some Balance IIs. Beautiful but flawed. Howard Levy retired several years back, and Bexley Pens, in a very different form, ended up as part of Emmanuel Caltagirone's The Pen Family.*

My Huron was one of a small number of prototypes made before the Huron went public. The original Huron has been retired, but Brian still offers a larger version called the [Huron Grande](https://edisonpen.com/huron-grande/). Edison Pen has developed far beyond those early days of penmaking, and Brian's production line pens are available retail stores in the USA and Europe. "Signature" pens are ordered from [Edison Pen.](https://edisonpen.com)

The Yellowstone Huron is my first "perfect" fountain pen. Sixteen years later, I still love writing with it as well as looking at the gorgeous pen material.
Even next to the beautiful blue marbled Aurora 88 the Huron's material has more life and dimension. The material has been used up as far as I know. Some of the old Bexley pens made in Yellowstone, like the Americana, can still be found on the used market.
