<blockquote><em>The world is round so that friendship may encircle it. So said visionary Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.</em></blockquote>

Allegedly. True or not, it's a sentiment I love.

I'm JD Eames, a playwright turned novelist. So I hope. Also, she/her/human in the Southwest.

That alleged quote by the philosopher <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pierre-Teilhard-de-Chardin">Pierre Teilhard de Chardin</a> came from an old wise woman who told me many stories of de Chardin. She'd knew him in the 1950s. 

That quote hung on my old wordpress blog—about fountain pens, ink, and notebooks—for some fourteen years.

I closed that blog in the fall of 2024, and decided to have one place, one personal website where my writer self resides. There's more freedom here to write about anything, as opposed to specific things. I'll still talk about writing tools (which is what pens, ink, and notebooks are, ay?).

Don't worry. This won't turn into one of those annoying writer blogs that tells you how to write, or complains about the hardships of a writer's life. That's always been boring to me. Besides, I'm forever a student of writing, not a teacher. The older I get, the more I don't know about everything. Not because of some elder memory loss, but because one's perspective broadens to a point you realize you only know what works for yourself.

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and a work-in-progress. Slow progress because I'm still very busy trying to finish my novel. This place is meant to be a place where I can take a break, work on the CSS, and building pages and posts. The site likely looks horrible on your tiny phones because I've yet to put in any [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) to accomodate them. 

The fountain pen in the header is a bespoke Edison Huron made from Bexley Yellowstone, an Italian acrylic. The pen was made for me in 2009 by Brian Grey of [Edison Pen Co.](https://edisonpen.com) A great pen made by a really good human.

Why do I call myself *Peaceable Writer?* Because I'm a lifelong student of peace and nonviolence who is also a storyteller.
