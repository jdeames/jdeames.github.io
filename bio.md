<blockquote><em>“My play ‘Jitney’ had just been rejected by the O’Neill Playwrights Conference twice. So I thought, “OK, it’s time to rise above your talent.’ But how do you do that?’ The answer was, ‘You can write below your talent, can’t you?’ So I decided to try writing the best play ever written...”</em>–<strong>August Wilson,</strong> Seattle Times, January 23, 2005</blockquote>

My stories often explore loss, grief, interconnectedness, and how—or if—we come back together after we’ve been driven apart. I’m deeply interested in life in all its forms (human, animal, feathered, not); concerned about our humanity and our survival.

My first writing-world has been the theatre, and my plays have been performed in San Francisco, San Diego, New York, Chicago, Florida and Alaska. A founding member of West Coast Playwrights Alliance, a playwright-managed theatre company (1999-2001), the WCPA premiered my play <b>Never Say Grace</b> in November 2000. I'm a grateful alumnus of the oldest playwrights’ workshop in the Bay Area, The Monday Night Group.

I've studied with several people over the years, but one writer was especially influential and I'm forever grateful for his mentorship. Playwright <a href="https://willdunnedramaticwriting.com"> Will Dunne</a> taught me all the fundamentals: how to construct plays, receive feedback, and be a collaborator. He always pushed for plays to be better.

Born and raised in California, I've been a nomad for over thirty years. Finally finding home in beautiful, enchanted New Mexico, I live here with my beloved wife.


Currently, I'm wrapping my dialogue-laden brain around novel writing. It's been a long, long, long process.
