Hey, if you're here reading and wondering, you're certainly special! Happy New Year to you, and hope you are buckled in for the crazy ride that's about to begin. Not here, but out there, where you sit. We have to watch out for each other, ay?

Personally, I've been obsessed with the Los Angeles fires. I was born there, in case you don't know. So far, my loved ones there are safe but traumatized. The damage and displacement are heartbreaking. The impact of what's happened will affect the country more than many realize. 

Meanwhile, here, there is a method to the madness. Maybe. Kinda. Sorta.

The site is sparse because I'm busy elsewhere, but there are plans in place to upload archived content from Wordpress, as well as new content about pens. I'm days away from finishing the current draft of the novel I've been working on forever. It won't be finished, as it needs a bit of refining and some feedback from trusted souls. But this particular draft has been a hefty load, and when it's done, I'll be able to focus on more than one thing at a time. (She says, hoping that's still true.)

What you see now is the basic scaffolding. More structure, like an RSS feed, as well as content, to come. We're going old school. This site will not track readers.

Thanks for your enduring patience.
