Over forty years ago, I fell in love with computing. Because I’m a writer there was the inevitable blogging, especially once LiveJournal came into being around 2000. I’ve used many platforms and stayed with Wordpress the longest. But it’s time to shake things up. I’ve archived my Wordpress.com blog known as peaceablewriter.

The top 5 blog posts over the last 12 months were:

1. [Tale of a Vandal Notebook User: Going Indie, Part 3 Chronodex]({% post_url 2014-01-01-taleNB3chronodex %})
2. Tale of a Vandal Notebook User: Going Indie, Part 2
3. Tale of a Vandal Pen User: State of the Hoard 2024
4. An Ink Journey
5. Writing Down the Ink: A Daily Blue

The top 5 posts of all time (since 2009) were:
	
1. A Bit About Platinum and Nakaya
2. Some Pen Weights
3. Tale of a Vandal Pen Collector: A Pack of Pilots
4. Writing Down the Ink: A Daily Blue
5. Tale of a Vandal Notebook User: Going Indie, Part 2 

	
It’s *probable* some of those old pen posts may find new life here. There's still a draft evolving about another demonstrator pen that had issues. I've already converted the above posts to markdown and working on getting those files up.

Of course, for me as an old person, blogs are not what they used to be. People come and read and take without a hello. Many pen blogs are now monetized. Years ago, I had to fight hard for real, concrete information about fountain pens and when I got it, I shared it freely.

There’s a lot to love about the internet, like the obvious sharing of ideas and information. Zoom is now ubquitous in most of our lives. While there are still broadband deserts, at least one of these—computer, tablet, phone—exist in more households than not. Ray Bradbury’s stories have come to life with the advent of artificial intellegence, privatized space flights, and [flying cars.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/24/flying-air-taxis-electric-faa-aircraft/)

There’s also a lot to despise in cyberworld—warring billionaire egos, dishonesty, dangerous fabrications, misused AI, and endless bots of harrassment and spam.

And so, I’m changing things up, throwing a stack of cards in the air, to see which ones land face up. I have to step back to find out what computing and the internet still mean for me. 

Meanwhile, find me in a well-lit corner with a cup of tea and a book.

Oh yeah, still writing offline, as always.

Stay kind and curious, friends.
