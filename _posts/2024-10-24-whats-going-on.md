excerpt: Top 5 Posts from peaceablewriter at wordpress dot com

Over forty years ago, I fell in love with computing. Because I’m a writer there was the inevitable blogging, especially once LiveJournal came into being around 2000. I’ve used many platforms and stayed with Wordpress the longest. But it’s time to shake things up. As of October 2024, I’ve archived my Wordpress blog known as peaceablewriter. After many years on Wordpress, the writing was on the wall [to move on.](https://slate.com/technology/2024/10/wordpress-wpengine-matt-mullenweg-drama-explained.html)

It’s *probable* some of those old pen posts may find new life here. I've already converted the above posts to markdown and working on getting those files up.

Of course, for me as an old person, blogs are not what they used to be. People come and read and take without a hello. Many pen blogs are now monetized. Years ago, I had to fight hard for real, concrete information about fountain pens and when I got it, I shared it freely.

There’s a lot to love about the internet, like the obvious sharing of ideas and information. Zoom is now ubquitous in most of our lives. While there are still broadband deserts, at least one of these—computer, tablet, phone—exist in more households than not.

Still, internet fatigue is real—warring billionaire egos, dishonesty, dangerous fabrications, misused AI, and endless bots of harrassment and spam.

And so, I’m changing things up, throwing a stack of cards in the air, to see which ones land face up. I want to find out what computing and the internet still mean for me. So—here we are.

Meanwhile, find me in a well-lit corner with a cup of tea and a book—or a keyboard—or a notepad and fountain pen.

Oh yeah, still writing offline, as always.

Stay kind and curious, friends.
