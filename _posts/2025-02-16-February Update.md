The draft of my novel has been completed, but there is still much work to do—tightening, editing, and polishing. This leaves more time for neglected chores, like working on this new site.

I'm going through old WordPress posts and deciding which to revive. The [first fountain pen post]( /pens/edison-huron ) is up about the Edison Huron I acquired in 2009.

For those of you with RSS readers, RSS feeds [have been activated]( /subscriberss ).
There will be a search box, navigation between pages, and a site index at some point.

Now, for some commentary:

>Of course it’s a coup.- [Timothy D. Snyder](https://substack.com/@snyder/p-156514044)

We cannot wait for rescue. We **are** the first responders. In my state, our Senators—Democrats—were confirming unqualified nominees until New Mexicans called on them to stop.  We can't afford hopelessness. We must keep the pressure on our representatives, no matter who they are. Big or small actions matter. Most importantly, we must take care of each other.

Hang tough and tender, friends.

See you anon,
--JD
