How the hell are you, friends? It's beautiful here in Santa Fe. Tree leaves are beginning to turn and the weather is easy.

Finally, I've gotten around to writing you about what happened to one of my favorite fountain pens, the Platinum Motosu #3776. Also, put up some old Aurora posts.

I want to promise regular posts, but can't. <em>(Hey! Struggling emotionally since 2016!)</em> But I do have plans and we'll see if they come into fruition here in the next few weeks and months. It helps that you have forgotten about me. hahahaha

Requesting your kind patience as the website is still a construction zone. Some links may not be working properly. Working to resolve those issues soon.

This young hawk and I watched each other for awhile yesterday evening.
